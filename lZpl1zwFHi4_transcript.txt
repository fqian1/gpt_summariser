[Music] before we begin just a small announcement you can see on the calendar here we're at July 30th let's jump all the way to September I am out of the country from Monday September 4th all the way to Tuesday September 19th so there'll be no um market update on September 10th Sunday September 10th and Sunday September 17th I'm not sure what kind of internet connection I'm going to have from the hotel that I'm in I have requested hotels with high-speed internet so I don't know if that's what God booked for me but if we do have high-speed internet at those hotels maybe I'll do a live stream on the 10th and on the 17th I could probably do a live stream the 10th I'll be in I think I'm still in Costa Rica on the 10th and I'm in Panama on the 17th so I'll I'll try to do a live stream if if it's good internet connection during the course of the week I'll put up a notice I'll just schedule it on YouTube and if you're subscribed to my channel you'll get a notice I'll have a live stream so I'll do a live stream uh as opposed to a a prepared video if I can but if I can't then for those two weeks uh there'll be nothing I think I'll still be able to get something up for the third because I don't leave um till the fourth uh for the applied series the next uh video was uploaded on Friday it showed a very basic uh income strategy a very low risk income strategy the next video uh in that series will be up this Friday there'll be one every Friday until until I feel we're done and I think that's somewhere five six months from now uh for understanding Banks I got the uh the credit risk one done asset quality credit risk it's the same thing uh late on Friday so it will be up uh sometime Monday during the day and then next week is the last entry in that one for Capital adequacy now that the new uh discussion paper the discussion paper for the new capital requirements has been put out it's only discussion paper we can do capital adequacy in light of the probable changes that are going to happen in the US in terms of capital adequacy uh and if you are part of the applied series remember today it's the last Sunday of the month the last Sunday of every month I do live streams uh for just the applied series candidates so you have to log into the site uh to to access that I want the first ones at noon uh the second one I believe is at 9 00 PM this evening okay let's go last week we noted that money market rates were making room for a 25 basis point rate hike we got the 25 basis point rate hike and week over week very little changed in the money market rates pretty much right where it ended uh last week and I think uh going forward money market rates will probably display very low volatility Capital Market rates did increase at the long end of the curve I think higher for longer is starting to set in the good economic data last week and viewing the economic data coming out it's hard to Envision a rate cut with this type of data uh coming out so we did have some increases at the long end of the curve I think if there's volatility it's probably going to be at the long end still have our curve inversions 389 days on the 2 to the 10 year 276 days on the three month to the 10 year the forward curve is pricing in with over the next 18 months 167 basis points of cuts almost seven rate Cuts Canadian curve also still quite inverted balance sheet runoff continues another 20 almost 23 billion down to 7.493 trillion and the balance sheet uh went from 8.2 for 3 to 8.274 a drop of 31.2 billion uh so there was a net drop of 8.4 billion outside of the Soma just to give you some context of How High this number is the 7.4 trillion that there's still a lot of liquidity out there um prior to 2008 the balance sheet was under a trillion dollars around 800 billion dollars uh 2014 to 2020 ranged anywhere from four to four and a half trillion so just to get back to uh pre-pandemic levels 2015 2016 2017 levels you've still got another three trillion dollars to go and at the pace of runoff now that's another three years and this was considered a high level for the balance sheet a lot of liquidity still in the system so as far as liquidity in the system even though the balance sheet is coming down there is a lot out there I think they could speed up the runoff of the balance sheet and they did say last year at some point it may become appropriate to start selling uh MBS to reduce the balance sheet but they haven't gotten there yet and if they do that that will be well telegraphed in advance money market funds continue to increase almost by 30 billion here retail increased by 4 billion both for government and for Prime institution increased by 24.3 billion the big surprise here government money market funds up 27 uh 25.7 billion Prime is down 1.23 uh it could be month end it could be uh money moving around for a month end next fomc meeting in September uh 52 days away 80 percent probability that nothing is going to happen last week was 83 80 percent that nothing will happen minutes uh we're getting 17 days and the July jobs report we get in five days if we go to the end of December the last meeting of the Year week over week the probabilities uh moved around a little bit but uh on net basically unchanged effective federal funds rate is now 5.33 and the reverse repo continues to decline down another 40 billion down to 1.73 trillion and our lags we've had a 25 basis point increase so the lags and the effect have changed a bit and well not the legs but the effect has changed a bit so if we'll just draw a line here and we'll cut it off here there's a 12 month lag there's a 24 month lag so if we accept a 12 month lag that means there's 375 basis points of effect that has yet to be felt fed has raised 525 basis points that means 250 has been felt and there is some thinking inside the FED that the neutral rate is around two and a half percent and if that's the case monetary policy has gone from very accommodative to neutral over the last year if we believe the lags if we if we accept that it works with a lag and we take a 12 month lag that means that monetary policy has not even become restrictive yet it's gone from accommodative to neutral and as I said on the previous screen when we looked at the level of the balance sheet there is still a whole lot of liquidity out there so it could be that The Stance of the central bank at this point in time in terms of the effect that has been felt in the economy yes you have dwindled down the balance sheet by about a trillion dollars but it's still a good three trillion dollars over what was considered ample liquidity uh and if we accept that the interest rate works with a lag then most of the interest rate increases haven't even been felt yet we've simply gone from accommodative to neutral and if we accept that then it's sort of when we look at the economy we look at the the jobs Market when we look at GDP when we look at a certain economic indicators um showing strong a strong and resilient economy it could be that well that's because we haven't even hit restrictive monetary uh territory yet if we accept that 12-month lag we have simply just moved to the neutral rate with ample liquidity in the system it'll be another three years before we get to a point where there's a lot of liquidity from ample liquidity to a lot of liquidity and if we keep rolling off at a trillion a year you're probably five to six years before you get back to where you were before the financial crisis uh so there's still a lot of liquidity in the system and if we accept the lags we haven't even hit restrictive policy yet last week I had said that it's probably time for inflation in the Central Bank uh to move to the back seat we're not kicking them out of the car but moving them to the back seat and labor or jobs data should be in the front seat so we'll spend more time on that each week last week we got the employment cost index and this week we have a whole bunch of Labor data coming out Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Tuesday is jolts uh Wednesday is the always wrong ADP Thursday initial claims continuing claims and for Q2 we'll get measures for non-farm productivity and unit labor costs there's been a problem with productivity being negative for some time the previous reading was negative 2.1 negative productivity raises unit labor costs so the previous reading there was 4.2 the forecast here is for positive productivity two percent going from negative productivity to positive which it hasn't done that for I think uh four quarters five quarters now positive and a drop in unit labor costs which if you're going to have a drop in unit labor cost either you're paying people less or you have higher productivity well we're not paying people less so to get a drop you're going to need higher productivity um and then Friday the jobs report forecast is for a hundred and seventy five thousand let's have a look at ECI for June 23 one percent uh annualized that's 4.06 percent if we look at year over year 12 month trailing 4.5 percent last quarter annualized was 4.8 percent looking forward uh 4.8 percent annualized now 4.06 percent annualized but we do have unions that are just rolling over companies right now Teamsters did a really good number on UPS 30 wage increase over five years uh and you have uh the auto companies that are up next GM stalantis and Ford and there is some tough talk going on there uh the contracts end in September so contract talks are going to start I think this week so let's see what they get um this is really interesting here if we look at the um constant dollar look at June 2022 uh negative real earnings and March 2023 negative to Flat uh real learnings now they're all positive and here is a chart that's given in the ECI as well 12-month percentage change constant dollar uh there is a positive real earnings there is negative real earnings and now it is uh positive again given the propensity to consume the marginal propensity you consume being so high uh with the uh um American population now that you have real uh wage gains that means for a given paycheck uh the individual can just simply buy more stuff now than they did last quarter for the same paycheck real rates inching back up last week still have an inversion from the 5 to the 10 of 32 basis points and very little change on the break-even rates same with fed fund's Futures very little change here uh November December uh sitting implied rates right around 5.4 pretty much where you were last week slight increase week over week uh going out to March 5.28 week before it was 5.23 so an increase of five and then going out to June uh implied rate 498 it was 4865 an increase of 11.5 so we've basically uh went from this last week downwards and I think if the data continues to come out strong this is what's going to happen to the curve which means this is probably not realistic 2024 uh implied implying the markets implying rate Cuts four to five rate cuts for next year and if you have this this kind of data that continues you have earnings that continue in the 220 range which is which what it's looking like it's going to come in at you have a strong jobs market and price is coming down this is this is the new neutral rate the neutral rate is not two and a half percent it's at least we have to accept right now if we if we are not going to accept any lags then the neutral rates 5.5 percent if not higher um and if that's the case then some fundamental relationships have changed in the economy over the last 25 years such that indicators that used to have meaning uh no longer have meaning the curve the three the three month to the 10-year curve inversion has a 100 track record now mind you it's a little bit early to be saying oh we're not going to get a recession now but it still has a 100 track record if we avoid a recession if it's going to be two three years down the road that is a that is a wrong signal leading economic indicators a 100 track record uh when it's at these levels of preceding a recession uh and if again that doesn't happen then that is wrong as well which means that that perhaps some fundamental relationships have changed in the economy and I think we can point to two that may be of interest to researchers to try to figure out you know why we're getting the signals we're getting yet still having an extremely robust economy um imagine that you uh um live in a particular Village and over the last 50 years you've been attacked by a neighboring Village again and again and again over time you're going to build up defenses against that attack such that when they attack you you you are pretty much immune from the effects of the attack because you've built up defenses against it uh in the animal kingdom there is something referred to as the co-evolution of predator and prey is that uh the Predators will kill the slowest prey the strongest uh will be selected to reproduce thereby creating a stronger let's call them gazelles a stronger and faster group of gazelles while the weaker Lions will never catch those gazelles so they'll die off so the stronger ones are naturally selected and they will produce a stronger herd that's what co-evolution is is that the as the line gets uh bigger and stronger it kills the slower and slower gazelles which means they're selected out and only the faster gazelles reproduce producing even faster gazelles which produce stronger lines which produce faster gazelles well perhaps with interest rates you've had the same thing with businesses over the years is that businesses uh you know 30 years ago I've said these these interest rate movements really bother us and new and new Financial products were introduced as a way to defend themselves against these attacks much like you would learn to defend yourself against attacks from a neighboring Village Corporate America has has built up defenses to defend itself against changes in interest rates and there's so much Financial sophistication now that the interest rate really has no effect such that uh companies uh have you know that even companies with floating rate debt have overlaid it with five year and 10-year fixed for floating interest rate swaps such that they still have a very low fixed rate and they're basically both their balance sheet and income statement are immune from these rate hikes we also have a different type of population distribution today than we did 30 years ago with the retirees making up a large part of the population uh they don't rely on income they're not job dependent they're spending down their Capital at this point so they're they're sort of immune from Cycles in the economy in a recession uh their income will continue to flow because they spend a certain proportion of their portfolio which is probably moved mostly into fixed income now they spend a a portion every single month they're not reliant on keeping their job so that their spending becomes more immune from changes in rates because they're retired they probably have no debt they own their house they own their vehicles outright they're not buying new furniture they're not uh you know borrowing against their house to install a pool they're basically living the retired life now maybe it's the combination of those two things that make the interest rate less effective uh than what it has been in the past and that could be why even with an inverted yield curve much of the economy is immune from that anyway so the signal is meaningless it would be like I built up my defenses uh so much against attacks from that neighboring Village that when somebody says they're coming again whatever let them come they're never going to get past the wall we know that let them throw stones at the wall it's never going to happen TLT had a bad week down 1.46 spy up 1.05 we have a negative uh negative correlation in there and I think now that we have moved away from this era of Central Bank accommodation where the yields that we witnessed for the last 15 years were a function of Central Bank activity and not really a reflection of Market activity since 2008 we've basically had a positive correlation between bonds and equities now that we don't have that in place and now that the Capital Market curve is more Market determined than Central Bank determined I think with volatility in yields dropping we may revert back to the relationship pre-2007 between government bonds and equities where there was a negative correlation between the two which means a 60 40 portfolio has its own built-in Hedge let's keep our eye on this to see if that negative correlation stays in place I've made no changes to my TLT position implied volatility uh dropping 13 week is at five percent IV last 12.6 percent mortgage rates up three basis points the spread between the tenure and the third year has decreased by 13. corporate spreads continue to contract look at this on high yield three 3.78 on high yield even uh Triple C under 900 basis points now this is interesting this is the corporate bond market distress index you can get this from the New York fed the link is in the description box um gives false signals a lot this is interesting here now where one just Rises they all seem to move together this line here is IG investment grade uh and these are percentiles this is the 75th percentile this is down around the 25th percentile here so uh what's going on with investment grade that's interesting there but if you want to dive into that a little bit more you can find that at the New York fed it's I think they put it up last June I just stumbled across it uh but it's rather interesting let's look at uh our mortgage reads agency of 2.28 annually 1.29 look at ABR upted earnings beat on earnings raised their dividend up 6.53 percent they are now up 70 percent from uh that short seller report uh when that came out they sold off to Mid tens 10.50 ABR is in the 1750 range up about 70 percent from that uh from that report uh since that report the company has denied the report saying well it's just a bunch of nonsense which I agree they were then uh um brought into the s p 600 and with this earnings report uh beat and and raise their dividend again six point five three percent bad week for REITs uh uh um real estate REITs these are mortgage REITs over here real estate down 1.78 percent um the higher for longer I think finally hit the sector and I've been saying it for quite some time that that that we are going to be higher for longer and since REITs Equity reads are very bond-like uh you're going to have to start discounting those cash flows at a higher discount rate and maybe they're finally getting it and down 1.78 percent overall pld uh prologis down 1.43 percent but they had good earnings and good guidance but maybe they're a little extended DLR up 2.19 still uh riding the AI the AI wave since Nvidia um started kicked off the AI Euphoria in the market DLR has gone from the high 90s to the low 120s housing DHI kind of flat Lennar up 0.89 earnings from polti and they were good up 8.62 percent KB Homes up 3.15 Toll Brothers 1.89 1.89 have nanian up 7.56 xhb up 2.38 ITB up 2.45 look at some of the housing data for June house price index month over month point seven year over year over year 2.8 percent I repeat that again 2.8 percent year over year in a year where you've seen rates go straight up mortgage rates go straight up the housing price index is up year over year 2.8 percent not down case shill or month over month up 1.5 percent year over year we're still down 1.7 percent but that's it the expectation was to be down 2.2 down only 1.7 mortgage apps pulled back slightly for the uh week ending July 21st down 1.8 percent new home sales for June down 2.5 percent and pending home sales month over month are up 0.3 year over year are still down uh quite a bit I think in a higher for longer rate regime given that the vast majority of mortgages in the US are 30-year fixed existing home sales are going to be low for some time the inventory available on the existing home side will be kept low it is uh sort of just a a great place right now for the home builders however I'm going to give you an analogy of what the home builders are facing right now um imagine a big Blueberry Patch uh in in the forest you walk into the forest and you find this big wide open Blueberry Patch and you start picking blueberries well you're competing with the Bears where there's blueberry patches there are black bears and they'll sit there and they'll go through blueberries like you wouldn't believe so every year you go in there you're going to get a certain yield because you're competing with the black bears and let's say the regional government decides to implement a spring bear hunt for two years well during the summer during Late July and August when it is blueberry season you go into the forest and there just aren't that many black bears anymore so your yields increase uh but the spring Bear Hunt is only for two years after that those bears are going to be right back so you have a temporary increase in yields that will fade away once those black bears are back this is sort of what the U.S housing market is like right now is you have high mortgage rates that are keeping existing home sales from hitting the market so that the home builders have this very high yield in the marketplace right now because they're not competing with existing home sales that will end those high yields will end when mortgage rates come down so the biggest threat for the home builders right now is rate cuts the more rate Cuts you get the more at the margin the more existing uh homes will come onto the market because I can get out of this house and into another house and the mortgage rate is going from three percent maybe to four and a half I can live with that but I'm not going to go from three to seven the worst thing that can happen to the housing market right now is lower rates because the new home builders would then have to compete with a whole bunch of pent-up Supply on the existing home side so the home builders are a great place to be right now their earnings are very strong that's the high yield their earnings are strong because they're not competing with the black bears for the blueberries uh so I think we can stay in that sector and that sector will continue to be strong because on an earnings basis uh the home builders are not overvalued on an earnings basis but what we have to acknowledge is that the earnings are higher than they normally would be because of the lack of existing home sales much like your blueberry yield this summer will be much higher than it would normally be because you're not competing with the black bears but once the spring Bear Hunt is over your yields are going to go right back down to normal yields because you will be competing with them now it's a busy screen I know but let's just go through a panel by panel the very top chart here is the dollar Index look at that let's just go through some of the data that came out in the US last week consumer sentiment came in at 716 on Friday the expectation was 72-6 so it appeared to come in light but the previous reading was 64.4 so that was a significant increase in consumer confidence or sorry consumer sentiment consumer confidence came in earlier in the week for July came in at 117. fomc did raise 25 basis points durable goods for June up 4.7 percent the expectation was one percent that's not just a beat that is out of the park second quarter GDP are Advanced number 2.4 now mind you it's our first look we get three looks at it right uh 2.4 the estimate was for 1.8 which is Trend that's that's it's considered Trend or uh um accepted as the trend growth rate in the U.S at 2.4 again that's not just a beat that's out of the park pce coming down month over month point two percent the ECI coming down one percent from 1.2 percent in q1 to one percent in Q2 incomes up point three percent this a real basis spending up 0.5 so incomes went up 0.3 but spending went up by more so the question is was it negative savings or positive debt were consumers using debt to make the difference or were they spending down savings well retirees dissave right so being that there is a large it's the largest cohort of retirees as a proportion of the population ever in the U.S so if you look at all the retirees and you look at the proportion they make up of the population it's never been larger so it stands to reason with retirees dissaving because that is what you do in retirement is you draw down your retirement savings you dissave that you could have incomes of 0.3 and spending of 0.5 with no real Reliance on debt anyways the US dollar uh the dollar Index was very strong let's move on to the Canadian look at their GDP the preliminary for June negative point two percent negative growth for uh GDP uh for May month over month point three and now we're sitting at a negative number on last week I saw in my portfolio I typically have Canadian dollars in US dollars I sold all my Canadian dollars and bought US dollars with them not a not a currency trade a currency conversion I converted them to US dollars so with IB whenever you make a currency trade you have a choice of whether it's a currency trade and it opens a position or whether it's a conversion and it doesn't open a position it just changes uh the quantity of the types of currencies you have in your portfolio this was a currency conversion I have already announced that I am leaving Canada uh part of my preparations to leave is that my Canadian Dollars are worthless wherever I'm going and if I'm going to Costa Rica or I'm going to Dubai US dollars or a currency in both those uh locations so I can use US dollars but I can't use Canadian so you know step one is find a nice rate and convert it and buy your US Dollars and I think the Canadian dollar is pretty much at the uh the highest strength it'll be for for a while so I may as well convert there so it wasn't that I saw an opportunity it was just look I got to convert to us anyways so why not take this opportunity so I sold my Canadian I bought us I did it all at one point um three one nine three and I put it in t-bills six month T bills uh that mature uh January 13 2024. I got a 5.51 yield on that the Yen probably was the interesting story for the week nothing changed um but there was some wording change uh and um it could be significant I don't know I I don't agree with the analysts who suggested that this is the beginning of a strengthening for the yen and that it has some implications for bond yields in other parts of the world I I just don't agree with it the yen is a funding currency will continue to be a funding currency and a carry trade because money market yields haven't gone anywhere and and you'll be borrowing your Yen at the short end of the curve using money market yields the wording that the Central Bank chose dealt with yield curve control primarily at the 10-year so let's see what they did and I'll sort of say why I think a weakening of the Yen or at least not a strengthening of the Yen seemed to be the most appropriate outcome whereas uh Market Watchers of the end were thinking it should strengthen there was a wording change um greater flexibility to introduce greater flexibility to yield curve control and the tenure was trading or was pegged to trade in a range of negative 0.5 to positive 0.5 percent and the bog Bank of Japan said we are going to treat these bounds as references and not rigid limits and announced that it will step in and buy 10-year bonds at a yield of one percent so the yield on the 10-year after the announcement Rose to almost 0.6 percent which is price dropping in other words the bank of Japan is saying we'll buy the 10-year but not at this price uh the price would have to drop a little bit more before we buy it and that would be at a yield of one percent and the thinking is well one percent yield is far more attractive than a 0.5 percent yield that will draw money into the tenure um I don't see that I I see it as the price of the 10-year is dropping why would I want to get into something where the price is dropping knowing that in time they'll relax it to 1.5 or 2 that the price will continue to drop why would I get into something yeah the yield is rising it's more attractive than 0.5 but it's still not that attractive and and we're at the beginning of something in which the price is dropping to me it doesn't make a lot of sense you are not affecting the money market rate so I don't see how that's going to change the value of the Yen itself you are allowing the yield to increase to one percent at the margin is there a Japanese investor that says well I may as well buy my local 10-year bond instead of buying an international 10-year bond at the margin is there an investor that will say that perhaps but I don't know that it's going to cause a wholesale change in the yields and bonds in in other countries because of that that possibility it didn't seem logical to say well that's that that will begin the uh the strengthening of the yen if if there is an unwinding of the carry trade then yes that can strengthen the Yen but I'm I'm just not seeing it with this move this just doesn't seem to be to be the right move when the boj starts raising interest rates there's the beginning of the unwinding of the carry trade or at least at the margin uh some movement on the carry trade which would which would cause some dislocations somewhere but I don't think this so overall U.S strong data versus uh the Euro and Canada has weak data versus the US so uh being that the US has stronger data than the Euro I think that speaks for the U.S strengthening because what's your alternative the other big currency is the euro and I think Canada has weak data versus the US which means that the Canadian dollar should weaken against the US dollar uh JPY still no yield it will still be a funding currency copper had a great week last week up three percent on the week Freeport up 7.43 cop X up 5.16 percent uh for uh Freeport I am selling 30 Delta puts uh every month I have an allocation to Freeport which I'm happy about I'll take more uh and I will get it by selling 30 Delta puts at some point there'll be pull backs I'll get them uh Freeport is also a good Target for an allocation Factory because it does have weekly options liquid weekly options which makes it more efficient and more profitable for an allocation Factory I will put that in the applied Series in portfolio Construction in a couple of weeks we'll do an allocation Factory on FCX or we'll look at building one and what that looks like from freeport's uh annual uh not annual quarterly earnings the presentation uh gave us sensitivities to changing prices here is copper the important ones here here's copper and here's currencies so plus or minus 10 cents ends up being 425 million on ebitda if copper goes up 10 cents uh an extra 425 while it's showing up uh in the in the price of Freeport uh copper is up uh three percent which is almost 10 cents over the week so ebitda has just increased for FCX by 425 operating cash flows another 335 million and I did show you the strengthening of the US dollar here's currencies uh plus 10 percent another 240 million it didn't increase 10 percent and increased I think one and a half percent uh but uh any increase is beneficial uh for uh Freeport an increase in both ebitda and in operating cash flow the reason is is all of their output is sold in U.S but their costs are in local currencies uh other than of course in the US the costs are in in in in us but Indonesia and South America as the US dollar gets stronger they could buy more of the local currency so they have a currency uh gain uh in both those and both those regions um Rio reported last week not so good uh they're much more exposed to iron ore and that is sort of holding them back in terms of copper Rio does produce copper uh FCX really only produces copper and while I shouldn't say they do that they have two mines that are that are dedicated to molybdenum but um a lot of their other product they produce are byproducts of producing copper so as far as a pure plate FCX is as close that you can get to that excluding non-controlling interests FCX sales uh projected for 2023 2.7 billion pounds uh Rio uh 1.2 to 1.3 billion pounds but they that's their production I couldn't find what their forecasted sales of copper uh would be so they're they're producing about half the amount of copper as Freeport is but they're exposed to uh the big one that they're exposed to is iron ore if we look at their sales of copper versus all of their sales uh 9.8 billion is revenue 1.1 of that comes or sorry ebitda 9.8 billion is there is company ebita 1.1 was from copper and if we look at underlying earnings 5.8 billion only 0.2 came from copper uh for costs Freeport has a buy using the byproduct method cost per pound of copper of 147 uh Rio 180 but I can't find the information of whether that is uh the uh co-product method or the byproduct method byproduct means like for Freeport a byproduct means I'm in this mine to get copper but in the process of getting copper these other uh Metals show up so I'll sell those other metals which will lower my unit cost of copper so that is it's that's why it's called byproduct it's an offset um if you have just the co-product method you would calculate the cost of each metal that you're producing then the the cost of copper is much higher for Freeport if we think about it as being in several different markets I can't tell for Rio whether this 180 is a byproduct or co-product if it is a co-product that is a very low price for copper that is much lower than what FCX FCX on a co-product basis I think is like a dollar higher than that somewhere around 250 a pound uh if this is the byproduct method then Freeport definitely has the advantage there either way real doesn't have a big enough copper profile to really affect its earnings and its ebit based on all the other things that it's producing that if you're trying to get as close to a copper place you can copex or FCX seems to be the better place to be with FCX as a function of the copper price FCX scene seeming to be the better place to be GDP for Q2 came in at 2.4 percent that seems like uh a beautiful number right but we do have a little problem with it let's uh decompose C plus I plus G Plus x minus m uh consumer 1.12 well what do we know about consumption out of GDP when we talk about the the how much the consumer is of GDP we normally say you know 66 to 70 percent of GDP uh while 1.12 is only 46 percent of GDP the consumer is only 46 percent of GDP typically uh you're looking at around 70 percent under 50 percent um I .97 that's strong G 0.45 and uh the trade balance negative 0.12 what did the consumer do 0.16 from goods 0.95 from services and within Goods .03 from durables uh 0.13 from non-durables for investment fixed investment added 0.83 non-residential was the winner there 0.99 residential negative 0.16 inventories yeah very little 0.14 for government spending state and local did all the heavy lifting 0.39 uh Fed was 0.06 defense up non-defense uh down and for the trade balance exports down Imports up and with Imports both goods and services and exports it was mostly Goods still positive on some Services we don't have a number for uh gross national income the relationship between GDP and gni is as follows take GDP and add receipts from the rest of the world that is a form a a U.S a resident working somewhere sending their money back to the U.S and then payments to the rest of the world that's a foreigner in the US sending their money back to their country so uh money coming in from another country money leaving net that out take out depreciation you'll get gross national income and this is unknown at this point in time um it's uh the relationship between uh fix between um fixed investment and depreciation uh has an effect on gni if you have a period where you have no investment at all you're still going to have depreciation which means gni will be much lower than GDP as you increase uh the amount of investment let's say that you exactly offset depreciation then your GDP should equal your gni q1 if you took the average GDP Plus gni or you weighted them it's just taking the average the same as weighting them by 0.5 each you get 1.01 um you would recognize that as being lower than what the reading we got for q1 real GDP is and that's because gni was negative gross national income was negative we don't have a number for gni uh this quarter so uh we you get it later on we just don't have it with the advanced number but in this report if anything is alarming it is this over here that the consumer is only 46 percent of GDP uh the U.S economy is set up in such a way uh that uh it it really the consumer really needs to be the bigger part of of the economy this is not an emerging uh uh economy where investment can lead for a decade or or a decade and a half uh it can have spurts of investment but it can't lead uh it is too advanced and too big to be doing that so you do need the consumer to come along and sitting at 46 percent of GDP if you had to pick apart something on this one that is that is the big one I'm surprised it didn't get more discussion uh than uh the discussion that happened it was just yay 2.4 and Off to the Races uh we went later that day this was Thursday later in the day the market sold off the market was up strong in the morning and the IMF had already uh we'll see that on the next screen had raised its forecasts for Global growth so it was on that Thursday that I thought you know what this short position is it's just not working what am I doing uh you know at some point I got to give this up the market is just not agreeing with me I still think that underlying everything I'm gonna be right but you just can't argue with this Market so I thought I'd give it to the end of the week and um if the uh if things just weren't working out I was going to shut down every short position I had by the end of Thursday the market has sold off uh and I just took that I took that opportunity to shut down the short position uh I closed my puts at about a buck loss uh on 60 and every Buck is worth 50 points right that was worth 50 bucks so a little over three thousand dollar loss on that I shut it down I have no short position on the market anymore I can't really justify it any longer um almost everybody is who was a bear seems to have capitulated and given up uh and it was it has been a wrong call since since uh the beginning of March uh the multiple just kept expanding and expanding and you keep thinking well you know the data is weak and even looking at this GDP report you look at the consumer at 46 under 50 of GDP you think but this you know this is this is an issue and early Thursday morning the market just didn't care it just didn't care well how do you how do you uh rationalize against the market that doesn't want to be rational or that doesn't respond to traditional macro signals this should have been an issue this this 46 percent it should have been an issue saying well that's not good but it wasn't not until later in the day when I saw the sell-off later in the day I thought okay you know what let's just take it I'm done what I did not want to see on Friday was the market down 200 points and I had that feeling going into the evening that that once I closed my position I thought you know what's going to happen tomorrow we'll be down 200 points but we weren't so I felt good about Friday the Mark was up strong my long positions were doing well I didn't have the short position holding me down and it was like thank you at least for rallying because if it had sold off 200 points the next day I don't know what I would have done I would have been really angry with myself last week the IMF upgraded Global GDP growth and the July forecast for 2023 for the world is now three percent up 0.2 from where they thought it would be back in April from 2.8 up to 3. for the advanced economies for 2023 1.5 up 0.2 here and for developed or sorry emerging and developing economies for 2023 up 0.1 only to give it back uh next year the next chart here is uh the dark blue line is actual inflation and all those other lines are forecasts at different points in time which when I saw it I thought well you know this is not making your point but if if we're going to rely on your projections uh this is not making your point at all in April 2021 you thought it would uh you thought it would do this and you were wrong it did this so you had another chance in October and you said well it'll do this and you were wrong it did this and then in April 22 you said okay it'll do this and you were wrong it did this and we can see the projections now it's been coming down and this was uh October the light pink line here was April and this is July they're forecasting it to come down slower and slower while even if you look at the fed's summary of economic projections and the path of real GDP and unemployment and inflation uh from and they release it every second meeting wrong wrong wrong wrong these are very difficult things to forecast in complex adaptive systems systems that are characterized by two big things non-linearities and a high degree of Randomness that uh there is this human desire to attribute structure to things so that we can understand it but I think it's attributing structure to a lot of Randomness so it could continue this way or you know it could do a late 70s thing and uh turn around uh I don't know that I would uh rely too heavily on forecasts if you take all the forecasters who have been talking about inflation uh all the forecasters from oh it's going to go uh all the way down to zero to no it's going to be with us for a very long time there are there's a whole distribution and if you have a random system uh it was going to be somebody somewhere that was going to be right but not because they were great at forecasting it's just that inflation had to be something and somebody somewhere was going to be right purely by uh coincidence and purely by Randomness the ability to predict these things correctly every single time I don't think exists look what's going on these are all these are smart people doing this they're not they're not uneducated people that are doing that they're they're they're quite sophisticated and sometimes with some very very Advanced modeling that that has previous shown itself to fit the data quite well and you have this sort of outcome going on okay let's look at uh spy here as I've said previously I have closed my short positions uh forward four quarter operating earnings 227 33 SPX closed at 45.81 that's uh 20.15 times forward earnings or to use the forecast for as reported 22 times the forward earnings this Market is not um priced for uh uh a soft Landing this Market is priced with the absolute belief that the economy is going to expand from here there is no Landing there is no Landing we are going from low growth to immediately high growth so it's not pricing in the hope that tomorrow is going to be better it is pricing in the absolute belief that tomorrow will be better so you've gone from Hope to belief four point four eight percent below all-time highs right now up almost 20 percent year to date I just never would have if somebody would have said all by you know end of July we're going to be up the market will be up 20 points if somebody said that on January 1st I would have said yeah okay Tom Lee thank you uh and here we are here we are uh unbelievable 4.48 below all-time highs I just never thought it if when money was free we thought 4 800 was the bubble of all bubbles what is this what is this I don't know uh anyways the economic data appears to support it earnings well they're not you're not getting incredible growth in earnings but you're not getting incredible deterioration in earnings either they're kind of coming in there these are the multiples we have um I'm not alone in capitulating here the FED staff economists have uh taken uh a recession later this year off the table as well they've capitulated Mike Wilson who has been uh you know on the short call since the beginning of the year uh he is in this past week capitulated as well I did a Mia culpa said I was wrong and uh so was I I was wrong too uh I did not I just didn't anticipate this kind of strength this kind of belief uh just didn't see it now I I think perhaps uh that there was some bias in my beliefs because I had a short position uh and I believed in my short position I think it made me believe in my short position more than what was justified and I probably wasn't paying attention uh close enough I don't know uh you try to look for some kind of Reason after the fact of why not not not why you were wrong but why you were so wrong like it's okay to be wrong I mean I'm wrong uh uh you know a number of times a year in in my pick sometimes I'll buy something and it just doesn't work out or I'll I'll sell something and it just doesn't work out uh but you know you're somewhat wrong on this one I have been absolutely wrong so enough enough is enough is enough I give up uh so I'm going to just focus on you know those areas of the market that I think have good long-term value like copper like a short US dollar uh uh sorry a short Canadian dollar against the US uh GM I think is going to offer a nice opportunity over the next month I think uh the um the fear of a strike will start to appear in the stock and if it does if it gets below 35 I'll step in again I think the home builders as long as rates stay at these levels I I think the home builders probably have more upside to go because they're not overvalued and I'll continue to look for stuff like that the mortgage REITs I'm going to stay in the mortgage rates as well ABR has just been absolutely great FCX is being great I've had a good time with the home builders although I did get out a little too early I think but I'm sure I'll have some opportunity to get back in maybe I'll start selling puts on them again this is another thing that uh that's sort of interesting here implied volatility last was 10.8 implied volatility has been running below historical volatility for some time now the options Market is pricing in a volatility to the options that is lower than the actual volatility of the underlying that's how much they don't want puts that's how much the market says no thank you we don't want these puts at all we have no fear you can't make them cheap enough for us to buy them we don't want them you have IV lower lower than the actual volatility of the underlying usually IV overstates actual volatility which makes selling premium a higher probability event than the probabilities would say because IV usually overstates actual volatility but not now 13-week volatility sitting at the eighth percentile so there we are there is what you're paying for the market whether you're looking at as reported or operating earnings on a forecasted basis so far uh with half the company's reporting year over year earnings are down six point something percent let me say that again earnings are down six point something percent and we are now at 4.48 below all-time highs year over year we are up year over year the market is higher and earnings are down some six six and a half percent year over year earnings are down and we are higher let that sink in the consumer is 46 of GDP not 70 percent of GDP let that sink in 525 basis points of rate hikes and we are here with these multiples with these relationships let that sink in it is hard it is hard for me to say these things and not want to put a short position back on by saying no no I'm right I'm gonna be right however uh you can't stand in the way of this you know one thing I I uh one rule that I've repeated many many many times over the years is never short momentum and I think we've gone from a fundamental Market to a behavioral Market in the last couple of months and this is momentum the other thing that I've been hearing a lot is ai ai a i a i a i and that is a future that you can't argue against because it is whatever you can imagine it to be and this was 1999.com uh you can't even begin to to to appreciate how large the numerator will be in your discounted cash flow it's going to be off the charts this is a new economy nothing applies we need new rules new metrics new ways of measuring things and and everyone bought into it and up and up and up and up and up we went it was wicked momentum you could not short that market even though everyone agreed it was way overvalued you would get killed shorting it and I think that's where we are here and I think going forward uh unless something big breaks if nothing breaks something will break something will because because of the lag effect those those rates will continue I'm going to show you something in a minute when we get to the notable headlines where we're starting to see something something big will break but until it does momentum is your friend until the end another big week for earnings 168 issues reporting uh between uh July 31st Monday July 31st and August the 4th remember next week is big on labor big on earnings 168 issues here is the list the spreadsheet is uh the link is in the description box I don't really like looking at it uh in terms of Monday Tuesday Wednesday I prefer looking at it in terms of uh the sector that's reporting so you can just cut and paste that section into a new into a new sheet and just sort based on the sector and this way here those sectors that you're interested in you can just you could just go to those sectors so there's your consumer discretionary there's an interesting one there's Borg Warner uh Consumer Staples energy and there's oxy uh any weakness on that one I'm going to take advantage of if they have weakness on the not gas side and they miss and they sell off 57 if I see a 50 low 58s 57s maybe even a 56 I will uh I will move in on that one very quickly I will sell the 5750s and the 60 puts yes if they're down to 57 and 56 I will sell the 60 puts on that uh some financials lots of health care I've never ever uh done anything in the healthcare space I don't understand it I mean I could spend the time and get to know it and understand it but uh I just never never bothered to make that investment of time uh Industrials there's cat uh their deer I think is next week I.T the big one whereas apple is reporting there it is there that's sort of the big one this week materials real estate and utilities utilities fairly boring overall I don't know that I've I've I don't know that I've ever bought a utility I bought the utility sector but I don't know that ever actually uh bought the utility uh Simon Property as far as retail is concerned that'll be interesting same with oh Realty uh realty income what else do you have in here Boston properties let's see how office REITs are doing uh and that is earnings we get a couple more screens to get through here not Market related but uh earlier in the week there was a heavy uh rainstorm here and after it was over I walked out of the uh front door and I looked and look at that a double rainbow in the sky thought you might like to see that some uh notable headlines uh that I saw number one big bankruptcies rise at the fastest Pace this year this was uh from the Dow Jones news wire uh companies uh entering chapter 11 with more than 100 million in debtor assets or those with national prominence 82. which seemed like a large number to me in 2022 by the same time this year it was 29 in 2021 it was 43. um we're at 82. Healthcare has the most more than 20 percent retail came in uh second and I combine that with this chart that I found I forget where I found it from what is this uh s cross asset research Quant research oh from fact set okay um this is really interesting the uh for the largest U.S companies Rising interest rates are not a problem the same cannot be said for the smallest and this is the interest coverage ratio on the vertical and the a red line here is the top 10 of the s p 1500 uh which would be in the S P 500 the uh the top 150 in the S P 500 this is their interest coverage ratio uh look at that there's somewhere up around 13 14 times uh whereas the black line here is the Russell 2000 uh you're sitting around two to three times in interest coverage ratio that's starting to get really tight two to three times interest coverage ratio uh the chart down here cash piles remain healthy among large caps but are nearing historical lows in mid caps and small caps so the top 10 percent is way up here the middle 40 percent way down here look at that in terms of cash as a percentage of total assets if you pull this back here for the large ones just sitting around 30 35 30 30 to 35 percent and for the uh middle this is the middle 40 down here uh somewhere around 20 percent the top one up here this is the uh the largest 10 percent of U.S companies have barely seen their interest rates rise and this is what I've been saying is the level of financial sophistication allows some companies to completely immunize their balance sheet and their cash flows uh with with a different derivative products the top 10 the top the largest 10 percent have barely seen their interest rates rise here they are here here's the effective interest rate sitting around three percent but you can see going back here's 14 15 June uh this is in June 2014 15 16 17 18 19. you know basically almost unchanged have barely seen their rates move this is the bottom forty percent look at the uh increase here they were sitting around uh you know four and a half percent sitting up here now somewhere around six percent and I find this one here really interesting those with the most cash hold very little of the overall debt so how we read this is this uh this is uh the s p 1500 ranked by cash on the balance sheet um so if we uh take uh uh this is the amount of cash right here so if we just go up to here from the 200 up to here uh we're somewhere uh at that point uh a 200 a 200 million in cash companies with 200 million or less in cash account for almost 60 percent of all the debt uh that once you get up to about uh let's uh just go across from the 80 percent here and uh come down here that if you got more than uh half a billion dollars on your balance sheet uh or higher um this is at the 80th percentile there's a hundred that's only 20 percent of the debt because this is this isn't this is uh cumulative right so uh 500 million or less companies with 500 million or less of cash on their balance sheets account for eighty percent of the debt those with 500 million or more uh only account for 20 of the total debt uh outstanding so it is the smaller companies uh that have seen uh their interest rates increase smaller companies which have a lower interest rate uh uh interest rate coverage ratio uh and it is the companies with less cash on their balance sheet that hold the majority of the debt 500 million or less own 80 percent of all the outstanding debt and uh I think the corporate debt outstanding is somewhere around 13 trillion so think about that 80 percent of that is concentrated in companies with very low interest rate coverage ratios very high uh effective interest rate and represent the largest proportion uh in terms of the amount of debt those with fewer companies you start looking at at these these little things you know we're at 82 versus 29 and 43 and you combine it with this and you start thinking about where we are in terms of valuation how low the OAS uh are right now in both high yield and Triple C that it just doesn't seem to make sense something seems to be off somewhere okay two separate stories I saw last week but that were related one was on TD site titled mind the gap so if you Google TD mind the gap you'll get uh that story uh and it had these uh charts and it was looking at GDP per capita uh first one let's deal with this Canadian population growth uh versus the rest of the world here's Canada over here here's population growth uh this is 2011 to 2019 average the dark green bar is 20 to 22 average notice that it is higher uh than previous which is a different Trend than you're seeing for all the other countries that from 2020 onwards Canada's population growth was higher than it was in the previous decade no other country has that at least no other country on here uh look at Japan this is why they're having such a hard time getting inflation is because they have population uh decline not population increase but population decline it's hard when you have fewer and fewer people to keep getting GDP higher and higher uh and to get inflation up when you have fewer and fewer people you have to measure things differently anyways uh Canada's population growth not only has it did the only one uh uh here that of the G7 that is increasing in in the uh 2020s versus the decade before but look where it stands versus every other country in terms of its population growth the next come on the next closest one uh let's say for uh 20 uh 20 20 onwards uh is the U.S which is a little less than half the population growth now this is where it gets interesting this is a real GDP per capita uh this is 1980 uh here is Canada real GDP per capita here is 2020 here is 2022. now it has been increasing the kind of misleading in a sense because it's taking large gaps right 1980 2000 2022. we don't have inter in the intervening years in here to see what the trend is so it kind of looks like well we're still increasing but look what's going on now uh versus the United States versus advanced economies we were kind of on par with the U.S and above advanced economies then kind of on par with advanced economies but below the U.S now Canada is below all three and this came from another story talking about declining per capita GDP uh in Canada I think the title was the the downside of population growth or sorry the downside of immigration I think it was called so the um darker line up here is U.S um per capita GDP and down here is Canadian per capita GDP and it tracked fairly closely with each other but look what's going on here uh you have low population growth in the U.S now the dark the dark bar here is from 2020 onwards here's the 2020 cut off very low population growth GDP per capita going straight up very high population growth look what's going on with GDP per capita it is starting to Trend downwards um because the population growth the you you have a level of growth without the corresponding growth in GDP means you have a lower level of GDP per person such that the national if GDP if we accept GDP the identity equals g and I g d p equals gni gross national income that the average income per person what this is saying is the average income per person is decreasing this is uh negative that's sort of a negative for Canada as a whole so that's I thought that was a rather interesting uh and that is the end of this one [Music]
