[Music] okay let's answer some questions from the uh last Market Outlook I didn't do one last week uh I'm having work done at the house and there was just way too much noise plus I had way too many other things to do and same with today I I wasn't going to do one workers were here all day long trying to get everything done before the end of the month so that I can list the house so uh it may be sporadic um as you know uh from The Market Outlook the first two weeks of September I'm out of the country so there won't be any uh any uh videos um the first one is asking about seeing your portfolio performance in IB the best way to do that is on the website itself log in to the website don't use any of the trading platforms don't use Trader workstation or uh or mobile uh the mobile Trader um and there's locks on there uh ask me if I will uh show that at some point in time uh yes I will and number three uh is about buying long-term options and rolling them over when interest rates are high uh options are uh uh not this you're not buying at the money that you think you're buying so let's go out one year um and here's the stock price uh and let's say that is 45 and if you think well if I go out one year to 45 dollars I should have a Delta equal to 0.5 uh you won't uh the options are centered around the forward price so the forward price uh might be uh forty eight dollars and there's where you're gonna get the 0.5 Delta so if you were thinking of buying you know 0.2 Deltas it'd be even higher so you do have carry the stock has to rise by the amount of the carry just to get to 0.5 and then it has to go up just to cover uh the premium that you paid for so just keep in mind that uh because interest rates are high forward prices are are uh higher the leaps are uh um easier to buy I'd say not easy in the sense of liquidity but just easier in in terms of what the underlying has to do before you make money easier to buy when interest rates are low uh let's see July was the most active month since 2016 for short covering and hedge funds uh and Fitch cut us rating the double A Plus as I'm doing this video the Wednesday August 2nd after the market closed yeah it sold off today had I just held on you know for three or four more days had I just held on uh it would have been a better day to exit today but you know I mean you don't know this like you never know all you can do is what's right in the moment and after being wrong for so long for how many points uh upwards and it just the the Euphoria just didn't seem to be abating at some point you got to say I give up I give up you know and I gave up and maybe it was just a bit too soon uh as far as the credit rating I don't think that's I don't think that's a thing other than um a dislocation for a week or two on on yields I don't think it's a thing I bought uh 25-year bonds today uh bonds maturing in 2048 I bought at a 4.33 I think a 4.331 yield on that which is not bad considering the 30-year um was 4.18 at the time 4.17 uh fairly confident about the bull case for TLT also trying to come up with a bear case for risk management is there a possibility of the Capital Market rates will increase significantly from current levels Well yeah if you ask for possibility there is possibility sure you know probability is the better thing to ask for but there's possibility uh the treasury also announced issuance and it was larger than expected so that is going to dislocate yields at the long end of the curve for a little bit as well once the issuance is done it should revert back not too concerned about the effect of further rate hikes since the short end of the curve mostly reflects monetary policy long-end influenced by inflation expectations real GDP surprised to see the yield on 20-year treasury has been well above five for a prolonged time in history um 20 is an odd uh tenor there's not a lot of clientele effect in the 20 and not a lot of issuance in the 20s so it's kind of like just a an odd issuance on the curve you could sort of just erase the 20 and just think that you know after the 10 you got a 30-year uh let's see the next one is asking about a pairs trade between small cap and and large cap based on um bankruptcy rates um I I wouldn't do it uh I I get what you're you're putting forward here you know short to small caps belong the large caps that's not a trade I would do so I I don't really have much of a comment on it other than say it's it's nothing that I would do so uh you know the large cap the mega caps have had a great run so if there's a pullback it's more than likely they'll pull back significantly more than small caps which haven't really participated that much until just a little while ago so it's it's a trade that I that I wouldn't do so when screening for dividend growth companies how far back five years yeah yeah I think that's fine uh I don't I know you don't personally dive much in an individual bond market any advice on key metrics to screen for when looking to buy a bond besides credit rating in OS well you don't even have to look at the credit rating the OAS will will be in line with the credit rating uh and the OAS moves before credit rating changes anyway so the OAS is the better metric um any valuable resources before you dive into Bond credit analysis listen that's a whole that's a whole course um you know in answering questions in the comments section I I don't have the time to answer that question it would be a couple hours to tell you you know here are all the things you need to be aware of I will say this if you don't know anything about credit investing stay away from high yield if you're Bond picking just stay away from high yield um grab investment grade but even then you know I don't know that you could do better than just grabbing an ETF that tracks it as opposed to buying the individual Bond the ETF is liquid and has options the individual bond is illiquid uh you need a dealer to get it done um it's just a whole lot of work uh if you're buying the actual Bond itself just get exposure through an ETF and uh especially with high yield unless you know what you're doing don't go picking because uh if they default you're you're going to be on the wrong side of that trade and you're not going to know how to how to deal with the process of of default uh with your portfolio you're shifting more towards the bullish side I'm not bullish I'm still bearish just uh you can't be short you know the the the name of the game is making money and I am bearish I don't think that we belong Where We Belong but you gotta make money and being short is a loser and it has been a loser for me so uh you know you just you can't be short all you can do is just not be long so I am choosing underlyings of which I feel very comfortable holding for multiple years that if if I'm right and the economy tanks in in the third and fourth quarter it never lasts that long lasts a couple of quarters before we start turning around again I'd want to be in the names I'm buying anyways so I'm not bullish how do you split the weightings of importance between don't fight the fed and don't fight momentum or does it trip back and forth between the two depending on the site I don't understand that part between depending on the cycle I'm not sure what cycle we're referring to um does it shift back and forth and yeah um but that's short term short term meaning that you know that was the message today was we've gone too far the Mania is ridiculous where do we think we're going we're not going into a high-growth regime are we crazy and so there was a sell-off tomorrow that may change and say you know and and by the end of the day tomorrow you'll wonder you know what could possibly take this Market down by the end of today you were wondering well how is this Market ever going to get a lift again right and you oscillate between these two kinds of of sentiment um I don't know that it's it's worth a lot flipping your position every couple of days and saying I'm bullish no embarrassed no I'm bullish no embarrassed how does uh sorry does the yield on TLT slowly increase as older bonds are sold well new bonds are added at higher yields yeah yeah uh when you were talking about balance sheet runoff uh this is saying that it'll bottom motor on 6 trillion then continue to increase it nearly the same rate in the aftermath of the OA crash um what do you think this forecast reflects are they anticipating their reaction to a recession sometime down the road or maybe they're anticipating in Japan like demographic shift I don't know um they uh the this fed is conducting monetary policy in a quote ample Reserve regime and the FED does have a description of what that means on their site along with uh a chart or a graph showing the insensitivity of the reserves to changes in rates which is what they need that perhaps that size of the balance sheet is what they need now to be in that kind of regime to conduct the monetary policy they want and maybe they feel they'll continue to do that that could be it other than that I I I really don't know I feel like the market regime of high directionality plus low volatility is really bad for long theta plus macro bet effectively I see asymmetric payoff because you can't collect enough money on your options to offset your downside risks you better be right with your broad macro View um is there ever a market regime where you just close up shop and wait for things to make sense um I I don't know um if you're if you're waiting for things to make sense just go go into cash and when I say cash I don't mean just sitting in cash I mean sitting in in t-bills just go sit in t-bills in the 5.4 or 5.5 percent on T bills uh and then just just wait they're very liquid so you can get out of them if they're 20 to 30 day T bills uh there's no no duration in there at all and the only rate that that will affect uh a one month T bill is the one month rate no matter what the yield curve does it can't possibly affect the the T bill because those rates apply to cash flows that are much further out so the only rate that will matter is the one month rate and that's not going to move unless the FED moves right so you you can go sit in cash for a while um yeah but if you're looking for a market in which it becomes really easy to do stuff uh uh that's the t-bill market and it will always be the t-bill market as soon as you step out uh uh into onto uh into risk that's why it's called risk is you don't know nobody knows nobody knows what the price of something will be tomorrow or in a year it's all just everybody's best guess as to what you think it's going to be uh whether you know a price has upward pressure or downward pressure um you know that's I think that's about the best that you can do is determine what direction you think the price will go in but as far as you know is this going to go up in price Nobody Knows the answer to that nobody knows in case there's some of you out there that think that there are some large banks that pretty much know what everything is going to do there aren't they don't exist nobody knows because it's the future and the future is uh basically unknowable and your opinion of the future could change the very future that you think is going to happen so if you think something is going to happen you may act in a certain way that negates that very thing from happening at least if it's a widely held belief or it may accelerate the thing that would happen that would otherwise not have happened if nobody had the belief so nothing is inevitably going to happen you know so it is um I guess I just don't know how to answer that one other than to say you're describing risk and that is the that is the arena that we play in is is risk there's nothing wrong with taking on risk taking on risk and crossing your fingers and hoping for the best that's a terrible strategy but taking on risk knowing how to manage that risk well then you manage the risk after you take on the risks that you want and then you manage that risk uh thank you for closing your short beta position I think the marker yeah yeah no kidding especially today right I was the cause of it uh could you expand more and more the sharp ratio is another good measure when assessing a portfolio with options uh is because a um the denominator of a Sharp ratio is called a standard deviation now all samples have some deviation within them but a standard deviation is very particular to a normal distribution so if we're looking at the return on the portfolio minus the risk-free rate and then looking at it per unit of risk this assumes that you have this type of portfolio but options uh create this type of thing right they give you skew so you no longer have a standard deviation right so you your denominator is the wrong denominator so the sharp ratio is not a good measure my Sharp ratio in ibkr is very high around seven yes that's how you know it's it's just a ridiculous measure it's the wrong you're measuring the wrong you're using the wrong measurement I believe the bottom chart the x-axis size of the company in s p yes it is yes it is when I I saw this come through I looked at it again I said ah that makes a lot more sense yes it is yes it is there's a story on zero heads yesterday about Biden's budget deficits in 2023 the US is on track to run a deficit of greater than five percent of GDP perhaps this extraordinary level of stealth fiscal stimulus is what's boosting the economy and keeping earnings strong what do you make of this hypothesis yeah it's uh deficits for as far as the eye can see same in Canada we have a coalition government a uh a left a very left-leaning liberal government with an even more left-leaning Socialist Party and uh it is deficit spending as far as the eye can see there I don't know that there is any idea in either the us or the Canadian governments that a balanced budget is any is is anything but laughable you know like why why balance the budget and lose votes when we can deficit spend and give money to you know interests and parties that will then vote for us that's you know and that's both parties both parties do that but the budget the fiscal budget now is a a campaign tool uh so the party in power has the ability to finance most of their campaign promises through the budget and the taxpayer gets the bill for that or should I say this is the successful taxpayers get the bill for that uh but uh you know if if we want to look for uh a lot of of the root causes of inequality uh in a society government policies Central Bank policies they do it uh easily uh they're probably more responsible than capitalism and democracy itself um uh you remark the potentially markets are moving from fundamental to behavioral in your view what tools should we deploy in such circumstances what tools um yeah I guess if if the fundamentals just no longer apply if you're if you're so far out of the neighborhood where you're looking at the multiple saying well look we can't even begin to talk about the fundamental story here with the multiple and you have to make up such a a magnificent future for the fundamentals to catch up with the price uh that sometimes that future is so Rosy it could never happen um it is psychology I don't even know if technicals would really matter uh because uh you can have overbought conditions you can have a stock that is well above the 200-day moving average you know three standard deviations above you could have a lot of technical signals saying it should pull back and if there's momentum momentum doesn't care momentum doesn't care um until it Until It Breaks once it breaks then then everybody uh sort of runs for the exit because it's done so what tools I don't know as far as as momentum goes uh you know I don't know I don't know that uh you know there might be some technical indicators that that that suggest that you know the uptrend is losing Steam and waning but here's the thing no one knows the future and the technicals have about a 50 percent uh hit rate the same as flipping a coin so flip a coin and you can save yourself years of study of all the charts and diagrams and lines and Fibonacci this and that and you know sacrificing Roosters on a Tuesday afternoon if you're wearing a blue shirt if it's an update you can get rid of all that nonsense flip a coin you'll be as good as any technical analyst out there flip a coin um because that's the hit ratio right around 50 percent uh and that is not just per indicator that you take a whole group of indicators you're still going to have about a 50 hit ratio because the lines on the chart are after the fact all this stuff is after the fact it's all after the fact um but not very useful for predicting what's going to happen next and honestly you know let's think about tomorrow are we going to be up or down flip a coin nobody knows nobody really knows all we can do for ourselves is say given the levels where we are am I comfortable buying anything and that's you know that's all we can do for ourselves I don't know where things are going to go when we're in this kind of territory where the valuation doesn't justify the price but the price just keeps going up no matter what the news is the price just keeps going up you advise in the past to not Outsource your thinking but it seems you're Outsourcing your thinking in Oxy could you please elaborate your thought process um well I'm I'm I'm relying on uh somebody else that uh I already have incredible respect for and if this person is eagerly buying oxy uh there's something there not only that he's got a history of taking companies out and he's getting to that age where I think he wants to exit with one really big incredible deal so I'll hang out there in comparing the roic and roce my understanding is numerator viral CE is notepad what's the numerator if r o c user but what's the difference between the denominators um well let's start with the easy one Capital employed is just that what is the capital debt plus Equity right so it's not it's not liabilities plus Equity it's debt some liabilities are not interest bearing uh so you wouldn't count them anything that's interest bearing is debt so debt plus Equity there's your Capital uh and then it is um just the return on that since you're including debt you you want your earnings before uh interest and taxes uh so that you take out the effect of taxes in case there is any uh uh tax assets or tax liabilities that are being used this gives you the uh an idea of how much do the operations of the business uh uh return based on the capital that's employed because you've got that debt and you've got that Equity right so it's got to be invested in something if you had all of that just sitting on cash on the balance sheet well you'd have a terrible return on Capital employed you'd look at that say well I can get that in the t-bill um so cash on the balance sheet will be a cat will be will have a drag on performance because well it'll have a lower return whereas return from a company perspective that's the more important number uh return on invested capital is just that it's what happens to be invested if you've got a whole bunch of cash well it's not being invested in anything right so for this one you would probably take your asset side of the balance sheet and get rid of the get rid of the non-interest bearing liabilities again just like you did with debt plus Equity right or another way of thinking about it is the denominator of capital employed is interest bearing liabilities which is debt plus equity for return on invested capital uh take off your cash and then on your uh on your balance sheet you may have some assets that you take off as well depending on what the assets are keep in mind there is no standard for these ratios there is no Universal standard for any ratio so you may see it uh you know used in different ways with different adjustments to the debt and equity um can you please walk us through the chronology of financial products that were created since the 2000s it's not so much you know and I'm not going to do that that that's a lot of research to get that done that's a lot of research you could probably get more information from CME for that uh what matters more is the moving of a lot of these derivatives off of the dealer books out of OTC and into clearing so that there's third party clearing for these and and that it's not uh a whole bunch of counterparty risk but you have some some clearing and maybe even posting of some margin uh so that it that's what I mean by the sophistication it's it just it makes it more a more accessible market and many more products have also been introduced but a history of them would be a chapter and a book um so I'll leave that to you would it be a good idea to look at those to find what in that supposedly new cycle is delaying the end of the cycle yeah that's you know I think it might be interesting for an academic uh to do to look at what the effect of of different Financial products are or the level of sophistication and you'd have to measure that level of sophistication across different interest rate hiking regimes I mean this is a that's a you could call it a dissertation there's enough there to be a dissertation probably uh let's see my question will the CFA will the change in cfa's course next year Well when you say next year I don't know what you mean by next year okay I know that sounds silly but I don't know what you mean by next year right now it's the 2024 we have 2023 two exams left for 2023 uh and um the 2024 content is up So when you say next year do you mean the 2025 content or do you mean the the 2024 being next calendar year you'll be using the 2024 content or do you mean next CFA content year which would be 2025 so I don't know what you mean by next year um if you're going to be taking level one in 2025 yes a lot changes um actually sorry that would be level three A lot changes for level one I don't know uh and even if I did I couldn't tell you um I can only tell you what cfai has already said so for a question like that I would just refer you to CFA ice cfai site and if they say something about something changing then that's what you would go with if they say nothing then I can say nothing even if I know a question for the Q a does it make sense to look at uh spy and inflation-adjusted terms well not really because a price is meaningless right if you say how much is that stock I say 73 dollars you say wow that's expensive well how do you know if it's expensive unless you have some kind of multiple that you're looking at so it's the multiple that you would look at and it would not matter if you have about inflation because it's the price over the earnings which are both nominal numbers so if price is going up because inflation is going up then earnings are going up because inflation is going up so it's the multiple the multiple is not uh is is not a nominal number so you can always compare multiples over time without having to adjust prices for inflation because you're dividing by two nominal numbers to begin with another question do you think it makes sense to adopt a tele-like position in the market just bleed slowly for a year or two by shorting the market or rolling your puts mm-hmm when the big moment comes uh it will be a home run yeah but uh three strikeouts and and you're done right then it moves to the next inning so and then again three more strikeouts and you're done the other team could be scoring a whole bunch of runs on you so you get one home run yay okay but you're still gonna lose the game um I don't like that idea uh you know um you know I don't know why it's why it's called a taleb like position I mean is that his idea is if it is it's a stupid idea so I would say you know why like why if I'm gonna bleed slowly for two years uh uh or a year or two I'm gonna want to do something else in in in in in in the meantime I don't know I I guess I don't know enough about what you mean by a celeb like position uh and Lead slowly I guess I just don't know enough about what that is to have any other comment than why you know uh will you be changing your strategies now the taxes won't be a problem well taxes aren't a problem for income generated outside a territorial tax system so territorial tax system says we will tax all income earned within our territory so if you get paid from outside the territory you uh you don't pay tax on it but there is a concern with territorial tax systems about something called double non-taxation so typically passive income being that it's made outside the country is not taxed but it can be taxed to the extent that it has not been taxed if you get what I'm saying so the U.S has withholding taxes and if the withholding taxes represent 15 roughly about most places 15 percent um tax so let's say that uh you should have gotten a million in dividends but because of withholding you only got 850 if it's 15 withholding then then you're good in in your territorial tax country you're good as long as there was a withholding somewhere as long as there was at least one tax somewhere on passive investment and that's fine but there are ways to turn passive investing passive investments into active uh Investments and there are structures you can use to you know sort of not really get around it but minimize that effect overall it's not going to change any strategy in the end it's not going to change any strategy I've never heard you discuss carry strategies even though uh you dabble in currencies well a currency is one form of a carry there's carry in a whole bunch of things if you go into Futures there's a whole bunch of carrying futures um if you specifically mean borrowing at a low price and investing at a high price yeah I've done that um it's uh I mean you can do it um you can open up a spot trade on let's say uh uh you know a low yielding currency and a high yielding currency go long the higher yielding currency you'll end up with a lot of money and as long as you put it in uh in short-term T bills it's IB considers it cash it considers it the same thing so you can take it and invest it in high yielding a high yielding asset sometimes just holding the cash balance in your account has a payment um so um I guess that's that's all I have on that could you explain why the fact that the yield in the past 15 years has been a function of Central Bank activities well because interest rates were zero where's the long end of the curve going to go when interest rates are zero uh uh lead to a positive correlation between bonds and equities well when rates are zero and the Central Bank says we are not raising rates for a long time well bond prices aren't going to drop in fact bond prices can continue to increase because there are institutions that must hold bonds no matter what um central banks uh uh in their foreign reserves hold bonds the largest foreign Reserve out there held by central banks is U.S dollars So they hold bonds you you never just hold cash you'll always hold something that yields a return um so yeah it's if you have a central bank sitting on an artificially low rate and also buying bonds called connotative easing um that whole yield curve is engineered so it doesn't really reflect the market it reflects what the Central Bank wants it to be um I found balance sheet data that's very important factor and did you know about the balance sheet number before yeah yeah I report the balance sheet date every week uh something we meant no no didn't miss it think about the fact that the market might just be feeling the full effect of liquidity infusion the economies it takes time for money to reach the bottom of the hierarchy uh uh I don't know how to answer that that that is an assumption that money flows to the top one percent of of of of of wealth and then it trickles all the way down to the bottom uh I I don't know that money flows to the top one percent uh and then flows down um I don't know that that's true I don't think so I doubt it um no I I don't I don't think it works that way at all uh uh not one bit uh if something broke and the FED cut rates to zero tomorrow what do you think the 25 or 30-year treasury yield would be well if something broke uh lower much lower because uh something broke money is going to leave anything that's risky and go to something that's safe and those are treasuries so it would be lower it should trade up around 17.5 percent to 118 of yields go up to three percent on the long end yep do you think yields would drop by more than that you tell me what breaks and I'll tell you and I'll I'll give you my best guess as to where it goes uh so it is it is a conditional statement you know rates are dropping conditioned on this thing happening then I'll have something to say but something breaking what broke right I'd need to know that first uh sure your skepticism that the FED will lower rates as aggressively as the market is pricing in as a retail investor how can I play this I can't short two-year bonds but want to exploit a higher for longer position by playing rate somehow then buy t-bills five and a half percent there you go just buy t-bills uh what are your thoughts on entering the bull market or bull call ratio of experts right potential momentum rally with having backside protection in case something breaks yeah I mean I don't know how much more to say on that other than yeah it's a strategy a more technical question how would you hedge a callback ratio mid-trade well uh theoretically I'm you you tell me what you have and what happened and then I can answer it I I say that a lot you know like whenever I'm asked about some future event and what would you do you tell me what happened and I'll tell you what I would do but just to say this is what I would do means there's a rule and if there is a rule then then it can be programmed in and algorithms would do it and humans wouldn't be involved and there would be no trade because it would purely be algorithmically done to the point where you couldn't even get in the trade um you tell me what's going on and I'll tell you what I would do that's about the best that I can say is it too late to get into the options course no it's just streaming it's uh they're already done in online streaming uh crude oil just experiences biggest weekly drop much below expectations it was a big drop yes would this theoretically imply a bullish signal for oil prices and Just Energy inflation may rise again uh well it's bullish for oil let's just say that I mean it's it's certainly not bearish maybe it's not bullish but it's certainly not bearish uh it could be bullish if the market is willing to accept it as bullish unless you're having sell-off days like we had today then no it it probably just did not matter and and when I looked at the oil companies uh from Canada to Mexico to us yeah they were all red all of them are red uh it didn't matter so you know the weakness in energy stocks was probably more in effect uh more of an effect of the market itself rather than than oil um suggest energy inflation may rise again no I don't I don't think so no I don't know that that on its own is enough for me to say yeah here here we go I mean it's energy it's it's it's crude oil uh in the U.S so I'm yeah uh no uh there's been an alleged events in the superconductivity field that if a Testa will make all the AI stuff look like a flash in the pan fortunately the target material is easy enough to make in any major university lab that by September should have dozens of replications or should it be BS it Bears watching but it would start throwing money around yet well how could you you didn't say anything about anything there's an advance in this field if it works it'll be great if not it won't don't spend money on this thing that I'm not telling you about uh it's a little bit more specific first and then we can talk about not throwing money around I don't know what it would be two questions um yeah and your comment on them potentially seeking selling MBS what impact would have on table Securities I've not heard that expression before I don't know what a table security is whether it's an asset looking so I can't answer that you're closing your short position does that change your view on TLT nope based on no TLT change that you mentioned your comment 60 40. I imagine it doesn't change your thesis on it that being said I'm curious to hear if now you think rates will continue to climb so the TLT could face further downward pressure in 2024. um from from what I'm seeing now with with price pressures coming down and not just in the US but in other countries as well um no I I I'm I'm having a hard time seeing that a lot more rate hikes are ahead I don't think rate cuts are ahead I don't think you know until it's very clear that that uh we're back at the Target which uh you know it seems that we're we're heading there so uh no I don't know I don't know that that there's a lot of upside left in Money Market rates now Capital Market that's a different thing altogether that's that's views of inflation expectation and GDP but if you if you have a lowered expectation of growth going forward and lowered inflation expectation uh the market will accept lower yields uh to get higher yields you would have to have significantly higher um GDP growth or significantly higher inflation expectations which would lead to higher rates which would lead to lower GDP growth to offset those higher inflation expectations so I don't think that would be the pathway to higher yields I think the pathway to higher yields would be inflation slowly moving to two percent but growth just accelerating and I mean going from an expectation of three percent to three and a half to four to four and a half to five percent real G like just an explosion of growth yeah I think you'd probably get something moving up on on on the longer end of the curve I don't see that either that's for my comment uh it's a comment so we'll pass on the comment other people can read the comment uh let's see describe the difference generally between operate on somebody already applied replied to that and they were correct I think most people in the market right now are buying based on the bottom-up approach um Maybe in terms it seems that monetary means are less effective now what are some fiscal driven actions the government can do to control inflation stop spending money they're not going to do that uh allow immigration allow higher levels of immigration so that you can put slack into the labor market and increase unemployment without people losing their jobs just newer people coming in don't have them they're not going to do that don't look to your government for the solution to any difficult problem uh look at them as a source of problems but do not look to them as for any kind of solution to a difficult problem if you want solutions to difficult problems you have your Central Bank you have your Treasury potentially and you have business business is is if you're looking for the tone and the change in society business is by far the leader politicians simply follow along uh but but politicians really aren't the solution to anything and government really isn't isn't really an effective solution to any difficult problem anymore so I wouldn't even even think about the fiscal because whatever solution it is they're not going to do it it's not going to happen uh wondering about retirees level of spending being more inelastic to the business cycle if we consider only wages this would be true but considering that their wealth has decreased substantially in the past two years well we don't know that it has decreased substantially in the last two years we don't know that uh since you know you got the vast majority of them 50 percent if not more of of their retirement values sitting in in their home and perhaps uh you know when we're talking about uh quite a few people still have access to defined benefit uh pension plans so that's not their problem uh almost every government employee almost every University employee that's retiring almost every middle level manager and hire that's retiring has had defined benefit pension plans so they're they're good the value of homes are looking at case Schiller on a worst case scenario 1.7 percent below where they were last year one point seven percent below it in some cases housing prices are higher than they were before they turned down last year so housing prices have held their value quite well um the market well up until you know the end of last week was sitting five percent below all-time highs so we don't know that that they're uh that their wealth has as you say decreased substantially we don't know that um with this affirmation about their spending being uncorrelated with the business cycle still be true yeah I think it would be um so let's say that I'm holding bonds uh uh three million dollars in bonds and now they're only worth 2.4 million dollars in bonds um I'm not so I don't have to sell my bonds the the yield on them is enough and as I as they mature if I have a good laddered Bond portfolios they mature I'm buying bonds at at a lower price with a higher yield and at some point rates will go down and bring my bond portfolio back to that 3 million um they're not like equities where maybe maybe equities will go back up when things get better bonds will uh and if you hold a bond No Matter What loss you think you have you're gonna get par you're always going to get par so if I buy a bond today for uh 1993 let's say I buy a seven year for 93 or a 10 year for for 93 I don't know just make up a make up a bond and make up a number uh and and rates rise in the value that Bond Falls to 86. well that's 86 if I want to sell it today I don't have to I can say look I I'm holding it for the interest income that's fine with me um and and uh I will get par I will get par I'll just continue to hold it and as each day passes that Bond will be pulled to par uh interest rates will will mess around with it only to a certain point but as it gets younger and younger it gets pulled to par and if I'm retiring I certainly don't have a portfolio of 30-year bonds I've got a ladder portfolio and I still have an equity position more than likely unless you know I I can't afford it in which case you know uh uh that's not really an important an important thing the the generation retiring now has probably the most wealth of any generation uh and that wealth is probably being passed on as as they die being passed on to the next generation and when you inherit something you are price insensitive because you didn't earn it so I know I I I'm I I think we have some problems here with saying decrease substantially we don't know that that's true uh and if they are in bonds and they have taken a hit they will always get par if they have a ladder portfolio which their advisor most likely would have put them in one they'll be fine or they have defined benefit and it's not their problem it's the sponsor's problem right why would the expected productivity gains be positive I I I don't know that they will be positive and the economy is good jobs are plentiful and households haven't felt the crunch yet why would people suddenly start well that's not really what what productivity is is is it's not just that you're just working harder uh it's that you're working more productive uh so it just could be that waste is eliminated right so let's say that you have a Workforce of 10 000 people uh and you cut the bottom ten percent you cut a thousand people you know you send the message through to all your supervisors say look we we need to get rid of the unproductive people and in every Department there's always one if you work in an organization if you work in a company you know there's somebody in your department or in the cubicle beside you or around you or you think they never do anything like they never do anything they they're always in right at nine o'clock they always leave right at five o'clock they're a clock watcher they smoke seven eight times a a a a day you know they're in the bathroom four or five times a day they're so lazy you can't count every or everybody in an organization know someone like that well if you just get rid of those people then they're done there is a uh some aggregate numbers um that that lean towards uh statements like uh that about 50 percent of the work in an organization is usually done by 10 of the people so there are there are a lot of people in an organization uh that you could probably do without that in Good Times you think ah what's the point but in in you know if you need to increase your productivity in other words decrease your unit costs um every organization has at least no matter how small they are let's take a company with 25 employees there's there's that there's always at least one person that most people can agree that if you get rid of that person nothing would change nothing would change because they never do anything anyways and when they do something you got to go in and redo it again anyway so you can increase productivity by just getting rid of those people so it doesn't mean that you're working harder just if companies you know send the bottom 10 out the door you get a boost of productivity right away because those 10 probably weren't contributing much to begin with uh what resources would you recommend to someone looking to learn about the capital markets CFA period the CFA program that's what I would recommend any thoughts on the latest GP now yeah 3.9 crazy 3.9 book is looking surprisingly strong government spending and inventories in particular yeah that is true anyone have a link to the forecast charts and interest rate coverage ratios I got those out of a story uh uh online um I didn't get them from the source it was part of a larger story and it was exhibits within the story I skipped last week's q a I did I'd like to speak to your manager let's see Karen no it's not Karen uh acknowledge your analogy regarding co-evolution and rates my argument against it would be that given such low rates in the decade leading up to covet has there uh even been a need to evolve against interest rates second question is is it possible to measure the level of interest rate sterilization the economy given it would be mostly OTC a lot of it yeah a lot of it OTC but think about 30-year fixed rate mortgages right and interest rates go up uh the homeowner is immune from those interest rate hikes so the mortgage payment on their debt they they could just walk around saying doesn't doesn't affect me I got a three percent mortgage doesn't affect me uh this leads me to the question who's on the other side of these contracts and how are they doing usually it's a dealer who Hedges out um and you have to understand um when we say that I'm that when you're immune from interest rates you could be immune from interest rates on a liability side and somebody needs to be immune from interest rates on an asset side well now you have a marriage right now they can both benefit by being on opposite sides of a contract so there are all sorts of reasons why you would be uh you know converting an asset stream into a fixed or floating or a liability stream into a fixture floating and the dealer sits in the middle will offset as many of those as he possibly can or she possibly can the dealer is the counterparty to all of these well actually their interest rate swap so there is now a third counterparty that's counterpartied every swap but think about uh a uh uh a corn farmer and a cattle uh uh a cattle rancher uh the Rancher needs corn uh the farmer needs to sell corn both of them have risk uh the they the farmer agrees to sell forward the entire crop to the cattle rancher the farmer knows what price he's gonna get the ranch who knows what price he's going to pay so corn starts fluctuating wildly in price both of them sleep well at night both of them are immune from the price changes in corn at that point in time now you could argue that yeah but one of them could have done better that's the point of getting immune is that is that you say I don't want to be affected by it either way I don't I you know so you you do take that risk that well it could have helped you yeah but it could have hurt me right so for somebody who for everyone who wants to protect the liability stream of cash flows or somebody who wants to protect an asset stream of cash flows or an asset value uh if you're worried about the value of your liabilities going up because rates are dropping somebody else somewhere else is concerned about the cash flow from their assets dropping because rates are dropping and just reverse it there are two sides to the balance sheet so you can always find a marriage what happens when everyone that holds swaps Futures needs to roll over well then that's where interest rates catch up with them once you need to roll over then yeah you're rolling over at the newer rates every other investor I know bought a house to rent out in the last few years a lot to mention vultures like Invitation Homes they're not keeping a hold of these homes to preserve their low rates they are doing so because of the cash flow the moment that stops it will run for the exit hmm since ABR has been up so much are you doing any option strategy to your position nope no I never do well I shouldn't say I never do I I don't sell the upside on them I'm more than willing to sell puts on them more than willing uh I would love to see I mean ABR has pulled back from its highs last week down to the low 16s I'd love to see a good washout in the market and ABR Hits 10 or 9 bucks I would I would load up on that little fella it has been my friend for quite some time with your level of wealth this is an interesting question okay with the with your level of wealth instead of continuing to shoot for a high score in wealth by looking at tax advantage countries maybe it's time to start trying to maximize happiness for end of life where you'll move to who says I'm not happy um and happiness is the wrong thing to pursue happiness is fleeting and happiness is expensive and you gotta chase happiness down it is the wrong thing to pursue and who says I'm not happy right can I not do both things can I not walk and chew gum at the same time I think I can many news articles point to Europe countries as having the happiest populations well that is a that is a statistic a macro level statistic that does not mean everyone in those countries is happy there is a distribution of Happiness uh in every country they may score higher on certain measures of happiness and certain countries do but I want you to look very very closely at the countries that do they are very homogeneous in their population and they have a very low level of inequality in terms of wealth um you need those two things together you need a homogeneous population and you need a low uh differential between the upper 10 and the lower 10 percent you cannot just have one or the other you need both so they are they they score the happiest because they all feel they're in it together that they're sacrificing for um you know people that are like them they have very homogeneous populations uh or would we you would say in today's language they have the least Diversified populations this is the problem with diversity uh and politicians saying diversity is our strength at the level of a group uh diversity of opinion diversity of belief diversity of skill is an absolute strength that the level of a country diversity is a weakness diversity taken too far is a weakness not a strength if it was a strength you would never have to say it you'd never have to say it it would be it would be it would go without saying but that you have to say it is an issue right although many have high tax rates and high cab gains rates they may offer you a higher level of Happiness via lifestyle I gotta I got a happy life I got a great lifestyle I can't even tell you how great my lifestyle is I'm I sound like Donald Trump there listen to me folks you're not gonna believe it but I got a great lifestyle I can't even tell you how great it is folks um listen uh happiness is the wrong thing to pursue okay uh whoever told you that that that you should be pursuing happiness uh has it wrong and even I think the Constitution uh you know was it was it the Bill of Rights uh life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it's not the pursuit of happiness that means anything happiness is a byproduct not something you chase look for meaning in your life when you look for meaning in your life you'll generally be happy and I got a lot of meaning in my life I'm happy uh but that doesn't mean that I have to take an unfair tax system and say oh okay uh I'm happy I'm I'm not I'm not going to a tax advantage country to find happiness that would be a hollow shallow thing to do I am generally quite happy I have meaning in my life which means I am fulfilled I'm not happy every minute of the day but overall if I had to rank things if it all ended tomorrow I would say I had a good run I had a good run so uh also if you considered buying a suite on a cruise ship and living on a full-time I know there are these these ones that go all the way around the world like they'll go to like 150 ports but there's a whole bunch of risk associated with those uh and living on a ship is not what you think it is you don't have a suite it's not like the Queen Elizabeth II where you got a 800 square foot Suite on a ship you got a bunk you got a little a little bunk uh in those uh and uh no I I don't know that I would enjoy that one pushback I have regarding the comment about intro okay I won't be answered this uh this is about who's on the other side uh if someone would like to earn his or her domestic risk-free rate in the case where it is complicated expensive or not even possible to access money market Securities would it make sense to buy UST bills and FX Futures contracts to heads of currency and if it's not possible for you to access the domestic money market security I doubt that there's going to be a Futures Contract for your currency um unless it is unless it's just a cash settled uh which you may or may not be able to trade in your country so you know if if it's that difficult to access something like this might be just as difficult to access what is your opinion with Industrials as an asset class over the next super cycle yeah yeah uh they are they are cyclical um I don't know I just haven't I haven't really thought about it too much um as as as a sector individual stocks maybe but as a sector I don't know I I guess I don't have a strong opinion either way on that one oh what made you choose Costa Rica and then do they not have a 25 tax rate nope well I maybe they do they have a territorial tax rate which means that any income earned on the territory within the territory they tax but if you earn your income outside of Costa Rica then they don't tax it uh are there not uh there are not many options that have zero to five yeah there's I think 12 countries in the world that have territorial tax systems and then there's the digital Nomad but God you're living out of a suitcase for you know a year two years at a time because if you uh get any possessions wherever you happen to be well you have to leave that country at some point that stuff doesn't move very well so you're you're basically living light for a period of time interested to hear more of your thoughts around socials and Marxism and your thoughts on if other Canadians are feeling the same as you and looking to become expats um well I don't know anybody who likes a 53 and a half percent tax I don't know anybody who uh wants to take the chance on our coalition government our left-leaning liberal and Socialist Party government our two prime ministers uh um are at some point are gonna have to pay the bills and they're going to raise taxes and they're not going to lower it on the bottom 70 they're not gonna raise I'm sorry they're not gonna raise them on the bottom 70 they're not going to raise them on the middle class they will go after successful people because successful people are too small of a class to change to to change the outcome of any election so they'll go after successful people uh uh so I'm uh I'm out of here um I'm sure you were not so happy to see the credit rating downgrade uh didn't bother me I understand GDP is an important figure to keep track of however I do not understand why the market would react in any significant way much less the way it did from the release because it came in stronger than expected noting that real GDP growth in 2007 was higher well you can't compare you can't compare things like that um you can't just say hey you know in 2007 a GDP report was higher and the market did this now it was lower and the market did the same thing well you can't you can't compare them like that why did the financial news meeting the market make it seem like the economy is strong because the expectation was for something so much lower this it the surprise is the number uh uh was much stronger than anybody anticipated that was the big surprise how does the FED having a large balance sheet means there's a lot of liquidity in the system uh well if they're holding a security that means that means somebody else is not holding it so what are they doing with their cash it has to go somewhere else so it has to buy something else so if the FED bought 10 10 trillion dollars worth of treasuries well then uh other investors with 10 trillion dollars to buy treasuries would be out of luck it'd be like sorry you got to go somewhere else this club is full uh they'd have to go buy something somewhere else and that would push the price of something else up uh not to be rude but now that you and Mike Wilson of capitulated will add to my short and you did very well if you added to your short I should be an indicator uh let's see how can we monitor the overall debt bankruptcy situation if you have a good data feed there's probably information there Bloomberg probably has a lot of good information is soft Landing achieved um too soon to tell hard Landing we know what is the finish line for soft Landing uh no Finish Line just low growth for a while followed by expansion I guess uh where's the next question here what I gather in your weekly updates you're leaving Canada mostly because mostly of taxes mostly because of taxes but I've been here well and I've lived in the U.S but I've been pretty much Western North you know North American culture my whole life and you know I've done quite well um and I want to see the world and I keep thinking you know when I'm finished this thing that I'm working on and then when I get to this point and it's always a couple of years down the road you know oh yeah I'll start doing this at this point well why not now like why not now so I picked one location and I could see two to three years there and then and then it'll be time to go to the next location I don't know what it'll be but I'm certainly not moving somewhere and that's it it'll be two to three years and experience something different take me out of my comfort zone and and see this big beautiful world there are I think two things uh in your uh uh in in life you have one or the other either you have a lot of family and relationships and this is this is your thing that you don't need to see the whole world you you have that and and that's that's going to be important uh for you later on I don't have any of that I have no family uh I'm not attached to anyone I have no Ex-Wives I have no kids I have nothing holding me here so at that point relationships aren't important to me because they don't exist uh in in in my life so I may as well do the other part of it which is see see Humanity see the rest of the world and what it has to offer and and you know so that's the other half of it is yeah I I'm I I'm not going to be a horse on this animal farm uh in Canada and yeah let's see the world at the same time I was a 30 year old in Hong Kong looking to leave the city Canada opened up her doors to us her doors are you are you assigning a gender are you potentially misgenderizing our country wait till I tell the Liberals oh man they're gonna take to Twitter and rip you a new one you are potentially misgenderizing our country uh what major downside do you see for people moving into Canada I don't really see a downside it's not a bad country overall uh it is it is I think um not a friendly country if you're successful um because you are expected to shoulder a lot more of the responsibility of the finances of the country than what would be I'd say fair share if we had a 40 tax rate as an upper tax rate I would not be thinking of moving but we got a 53 and a half percent tax rate well that's that's a 40 tax rate and a 13 and a half percent confiscation rate now you're taking fifty three and a half percent of my income and saying okay the rest is yours to spend but we have a 13 sales tax as well right but let's say I want to go buy a 250 000 car you would think that after getting hit with fifty three and a half percent and after 13 geez that's enough right well in Canada anything over a hundred thousand has a luxury tax you pay another twenty percent tax so have a consumption tax for luxury items or have a high income tax but don't have both because now you're just punishing us every single way you possibly can you do very well we're gonna punish you oh and if you want to enjoy the fruits of your labor with whatever you have left we're gonna punish you again um and then you have uh prime minister Singh we have two prime ministers in Canada one that was elected uh one that really holds the power which is Jag meat saying Trudeau can't do what he wants unless Jag meat agrees uh he wants to implement a wealth tax which means that we're going to tax you at 53 and a half percent and next year we'll come back we'll take another two next year we'll come back we'll take another two next year we'll come back we'll take another two so over the next 20 years you're going to take 40 percent on top of the 53 percent you're 93.5 percent tax and if I try to spend the six and a half cents I have left I gotta pay 13 sales tax on it give me a break you know you can't make me responsible for everybody's failure at some point enough is enough so yeah I'm getting out of here before the wealth tax comes in um yeah so just you know Canada is a great place but just try not to be too successful if if you're just successful enough you'll be okay if you're too successful well then you will be punished you will be punished uh um let's see uh can you show us how you get the values for c i g x and M yeah table two just to get the GDP report from the Bea Bureau of economic analysis and it is a table two uh gives you the contribution of each section to the tools 2.4 percent it gives you the contribution of that two percent for each of the components and there we go [Music]
